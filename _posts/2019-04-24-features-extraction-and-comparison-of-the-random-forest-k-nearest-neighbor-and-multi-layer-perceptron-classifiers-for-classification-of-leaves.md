title: "Features extraction and comparison of the Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbor and Multi-Layer Perceptron classifiers for classification of leaves"
comments: true
description: "Recognition of plant images is one of the researchsubjects of image analysis, many studies have focused theirresearch on feature extraction in order to classify leaves dependingon their species. In this paper, more than 20000 photosof 184 different species of leaves from the leafsnap dataset areintroduced with, as objective, to extract their color, texture andshape features and classify them according to these features. Oncethe features extracted, they are combined and used to train andtest the Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbor and Multi-LayerPerceptron classifiers. The result of this study is allowing thecomparison of these three classifiers based on two criteria: theaccuracy and the execution time."
