Master student in computer science at Uppsala University, these last years, I have accomplished many IT projects (Accessible on my Github profile - https://github.com/LionelJouin) and participated to many events that allowed me to improve my skills in development, team and project management, teamwork and my adaptation in various situation.

Until now, I have taken several opportunities, as becoming a Microsoft Student Partner that allowed me to improve my skills in many domains (communication, IT, Microsoft technologies...). I have also created an association which permits me to organize hackathons and challenges and introduce IT, new technologies, and programming to people.
